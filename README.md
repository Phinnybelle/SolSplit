## üöÄ About The Project

**SolSplit** is a decentralized application designed to bring clarity, trust, and efficiency to managing shared expenses. Built on the Solana blockchain, it solves the common problems of tracking shared bills by creating a transparent, shared ledger for each group.

Our key innovation is the use of a central platform wallet for collections, which removes the need to trust a single group member with funds. Payments are made effortlessly using Solana Pay's QR code technology. This repository contains the feature-rich frontend prototype developed by our team.

### Built With

- React  
- TailwindCSS  
- Solana Pay  
- Vite  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Node.js (for local development)

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Simple Authentication:** A familiar and easy **username/password** onboarding process.  
- **Centralized Dashboard:** A responsive hub displaying real-time balances for **"You Owe"** and **"Total Owed to SolSplit,"** along with a list of recent transactions.  
- **Dynamic Group Management:**
  - Create groups with custom names and categories.  
  - **Add or remove members** from a group at any time.  
  - Mock validation ensures Solana wallet addresses meet a minimum length requirement.  
- **Intuitive Bill Splitting Flow:** A seamless three-step process:  
  1. **Add a Bill** with a description, amount, and group.  
  2. **Split the Bill** using interactive sliders.  
  3. **Confirm & Generate QR Codes** for each member's specific debt.  
- **Clickable Transaction History:** View past transactions and see a detailed breakdown of who paid and who is still pending. Each transaction is clearly marked as **"Pending"** or **"Completed."**  
- **Manual Payment Tracking:** A "Mark as Paid" feature allows the bill creator to manually update the payment status of any member, including themselves.  
- **Solana Pay QR Codes:** Generate unique QR codes for each debt that can be scanned by any Solana-compatible wallet for instant and secure payments.
